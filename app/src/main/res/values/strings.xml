    <string name="ex1"> The simplest way to tell between these reptiles is by the shape of their snout.
    Alligators and caimans have more rounded snouts, whilst crocodiles are closer to a \'V\' shape, but
        gharials have very thin, long snouts.These prehistoric looking creatures also belong to different
        families, with alligators and caimans being part of the alligatoridae family,
    crocodiles within crocodylidae, and gharials within the closely related group of Gavialidae. </string>
    
    <string name="ex2"> This group is beautifully spotted but have many distinctions. A cheetah is found
    mainly in African and Asian grasslands and is the smallest and lightest of the group, built
    for speed and holding the title as the fastest land animal. It has dark spots which are solid and round, unlike the
    rosette shapes of leopards, which live across Africa, Middle East and Asia. Jaguars are fund across the Americas
    and also have rosette shaped spots, but are larger in size and stronger than leopards.</string>
